These activists, including prominent figures such as **“Long Hair” Leung Kwok-hung, Lam Cheuk-ting, Helena Wong, Raymond Chan, Gwyneth Ho, and Owen Chow**, were sentenced in November 2024 for their roles in an unofficial 2020 primary election, which authorities labeled a subversive plot under the Beijing-imposed national security law[1][2][3].\n\n- **Appeal Proceedings:** The hearings are scheduled to last for 10 working days and are overseen by three Court of Appeal judges: Jeremy Poon, Anthea Pang, and Derek Pang[1].\n- **Sentences:** The appellants received prison terms ranging from six-and-a-half years to seven years and nine months. Owen Chow received the harshest penalty among them—seven years and nine months[1][2][3].\n- **Withdrawals:** Michael Pang withdrew his appeal on the first day, reducing the number of appellants to 12[2].\n- **Government Appeal:** The government is also appealing the acquittal of ex-district councillor Lawrence Lau[1].\n- **International Reaction:** The case has drawn criticism from the United States, Britain, the European Union, and human rights organizations, who argue it demonstrates the erosion of freedoms and suppression of peaceful opposition in Hong Kong[2][3].\n\n**Visuals and Images:**  \nNo images or photos from the July 14, 2025, court proceedings are included in the available search results. The articles focus on reporting the legal developments and listing the key figures involved, but do not provide visual content or descriptions of the courtroom scene[1][2][3][4].\n\nIf you need a description for editorial purposes:  \n*The scene at the Hong Kong courthouse is marked by heightened security, with supporters and media gathered outside. The defendants, many of whom have been in custody for over four years, are brought into the courtroom under escort. The atmosphere is tense, reflecting the high stakes and international attention on the proceedings.*\n\nIf you require actual photographs, you may need to consult major news photo agencies or the official websites of the cited news outlets, as the current search results do not supply direct images."

    "content": "A **Hong Kong court began hearing appeals on July 14, 2025, from 12 democracy campaigners** who were jailed for subversion last year in the city’s largest national security case[2][3][4]. These individuals were among 45 opposition figures convicted in November 2024 over their involvement in a 2020 informal primary election, which authorities labeled a subversive plot under the Beijing-imposed national security law[2][3]. The proceedings are being held in the West Kowloon Law Courts Building, the city's largest courtroom, with significant public and police presence outside the courthouse[1][2].\n\n**Key figures appealing their convictions and sentences include:**\n- Ex-lawmakers \"Long Hair\" Leung Kwok-hung, Lam Cheuk-ting, Helena Wong, and Raymond Chan\n- Owen Chow, a 28-year-old activist who received the harshest penalty among the group—seven years and nine months in jail[2][3]\n\nThe hearings are scheduled to last 10 days. Former district councillor Michael Pang withdrew his appeal on Monday morning, reducing the number of appellants to 12[2][4]. Some of the appellants have already spent more than four years in detention[2][3].\n\n**Public and Security Measures:**\n- Around 40 people queued outside the courthouse early in the morning for public gallery tickets, with police conducting searches and ID checks[1][2].\n- Dozens of police officers and police dogs patrolled the area, and vehicles entering the courthouse were thoroughly inspected[1].\n\n**International and Local Reactions:**\n- Critics, including the United States, Britain, and the European Union, argue that the case demonstrates how the national security law has eroded freedoms and suppressed peaceful opposition in Hong Kong[2][3].\n- Amnesty International described the appeal as a \"pivotal test\" for free expression in the city[2][3].\n\n**Images and Visuals:**\n- While the search results do not provide direct images, they describe scenes of people queuing outside the courthouse, police presence with cordons and dog patrols, and public interest in attending the hearings[1][2].\n- The atmosphere is described as tense but orderly, with both supporters and security forces highly visible.\n\nIf you require specific images, you may need to consult news agencies or photo services covering the event, as the search results only provide detailed descriptions of the scene."

    "content": "# ENHANCED TITLE:  \nHong Kong Court Hears Landmark Appeals from Jailed Pro-Democracy Activists in National Security Case\n\n## SUMMARY\nA Hong Kong court has begun hearing appeals from 12 jailed pro-democracy campaigners and the government in the city’s largest national security case, centered on the 2020 unofficial primary election. The proceedings, involving some of Hong Kong’s most prominent opposition figures, are seen as a critical test for the city’s legal system and civil liberties under the Beijing-imposed national security law[1][2][3][4].\n\n## KEY POINTS\n• **Twelve jailed activists**—including ex-lawmakers “Long Hair” Leung Kwok-hung, Lam Cheuk-ting, Helena Wong, and Raymond Chan—are appealing convictions and sentences for subversion linked to their roles in the 2020 primary election[1][2][3].  \n• The appeal hearings, overseen by three Court of Appeal judges, are scheduled to last for 10 working days and include a government appeal against the acquittal of ex-district councillor Lawrence Lau[1].  \n• Sentences for the appellants range from six-and-a-half years to seven years and nine months; Owen Chow received the harshest penalty among them[1][2][3].  \n• Former district councillor Michael Pang withdrew his appeal on the first day, reducing the number of appellants to 12[2].  \n• The case has drawn strong international criticism, with rights groups and Western governments warning it highlights the erosion of freedoms and suppression of peaceful opposition in Hong Kong[2][3][4].\n\n## WHY IT MATTERS\nThe outcome of these appeals will shape the future of political dissent and judicial independence in Hong Kong, with significant implications for civil society and the city’s global reputation. Many residents and international observers see the case as a bellwether for the extent of Beijing’s influence and the resilience of Hong Kong’s legal protections for free expression and assembly[2][3][4]. The proceedings are closely watched as a pivotal moment for the city’s autonomy and rule of law."
